The Sound-Text Archive of Muslim Women of West Africa 

The Sound-Text Archive of Muslim Women of West Africa (STAMWWA) serves as a repository of "voices," conveying the auditory narratives of Muslim women across West Africa and its diaspora. 
Originating from a teaching module and a questionnaire sent through WhatsApp, this archive amalgamates audible accounts addressing contemporary issues surrounding faith and practice, while simultaneously promoting the use of African languages in responses.
